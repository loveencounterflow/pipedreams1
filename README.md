## pipedreams

Common text operations for piped NodeJS streams.

> "**a stream is just a series of things over time**. if you were to re-implement your
> library to use your own stream implementation, you'ld end up with an 80% clone
> of NodeJS core streams (and get 20% wrong). so why not just use core streams?"—*paraphrased
> from Dominic Tarr, Nodebp April 2014: The History of Node.js Streams.*
